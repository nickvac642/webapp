# webapp: EboardEvals
First fullstack Webapp written for CSH@RIT. Front-end is written in React and the back-end is in express js.

# What I Learned:
Seeing that this is my first fullstack webapp I learned a ton and am continuing to learn a ton as i add new features and hit new roadblocks. I had no idea what express or react were and now have a decent understaning of creating request to and from the back-end. It is rather simple but features some inuituve features such as handling the state change as the drop down option is selected and characters are entered into the text boxes.

# Why I Made This:
I've always wanted to contribute to Computer Science House here at Rochester Institute of Technology and desperately wanted to learn something I had zero experience with.

# Hardest Part:
The hardest part is what im currently struggling with, I need to interface with LDAP since CSH has its own SSO but react does not have great native support for LDAP so I'm probably going to have to write my own library to function with it. The other hard part was simply learning how the client connects to the server and handling routes.
